# Python Page Insights Client

Currently, it is used by https://github.com/pycontw/pycon-etl . Check [dags/ods/fb_page_insights/udfs/fb_page_insights_data_uploader.py](https://github.com/pycontw/pycon-etl/blob/master/dags/ods/fb_page_insights/dags/fb_page_insights_2_bigquery.py) as an example of how to use this Python module.

## Usage

### Get needed secrets first

https://github.com/facebook/facebook-python-business-sdk#register-an-app is a reference and the steps are 
1. create a FB app and get its `app_id` and `secret`, 
2. In terms of `user_access_token/page_access_token`, make sure you are a registered developer of this fb app, and get user_access_token or page_user_token on Graph Explorer with selected scopes, read_insights & pages_read_engagement. Either user_token or page_token is working. You will get a short-term token by default, expired in 2 or 3 months. To get long-term token, choose either of the below ways
    - this library will automatically get the long-lived token and cache it in local db.json
    - manually use Graph Exploer -> Access token tool -> Extend access token to get long-lived token first.

Rather than Graph Explorer, https://github.com/pycontw/python-fb-page-insights-client/issues/6 introduces another way which does not to be a registered developer of this fb app. But this way is not recommended. 

### Pass secrets 

After getting secrets, you need to pass below arguments to the library 

```
fb_user_access_token=
fb_app_id=
fb_app_secret=
fb_default_page_id=
fb_default_page_access_token=
```

You can choose any of below ways:
- pass them as function parameters
- manually export them as environment variables
- create a .env to include them

if fb_default_page_access_token is filled and valid, fb_user_access_token usage will be skipped. fb_user_access_token is used to get page token internally. So you only need to fill either a valid fb_default_page_access_token or fb_user_access_token.

You can skip fb_app_id and fb_app_secret if you are sure if fb_user_access_token/fb_default_page_access_token is long-lived token. In https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/accesstoken/, You can paste the token to check its "Expires" and "Valid" field.

## Fetch data 

Use `FBPageInsight` class to fetch. Please checkout the unit test code as an example. You also need to find out the fb page id and has the permission to get data, e.g. admin/analyst role.

### Rate limit

- [Application level limit](https://developers.facebook.com/apps/1111808169305965/rate-limit-details/app/) When using a user access token, the rate limit is 200 request per hour per token. You can check reamining quota shown in fb app dashboard, e.g. https://developers.facebook.com/apps/fb_dev_app_id]/rate-limit-details/app/
    - api response header includes `x-app-usage`
- [Page-Level Rate Limiting](https://developers.facebook.com/apps/1111808169305965/rate-limit-details/new_page/): for using a page token 
    - Business Use Case (BUC) Rate Limits
        - `Calls within one hour = 4800 * Number of Engaged Users`
        - api response header inclues `x-business-use-case-usage`

## Development

1. `poetry shell`
2. `poetry install`


### Run tests

Two methods:

- `python -m tests.test_fb_page_insights`
- In VSCode, `cmd+shift+p` to choose either item
  - `Python: Run All Tests`
  - `Python: Debug All Tests`
  - click any `run test`/`debug test` in `test_fb_page_insights.py`
